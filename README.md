# ECCE372A_FinalProject
Automated Pitch and Harmonic Identification

Involves a two switches to determine input and output mode while the switch is pressed, potentially two/three timers, LCD Display, LED Matrix w/ SPI communication, and  a playback speaker - Look into LM386 for speaker output, not necessarily a piezo buzzer

A good reference for the manual id process for the frequency is: https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Frequency-Detection/
